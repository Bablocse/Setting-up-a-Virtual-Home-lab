A Virtual Home Lab is a cost-effective and flexible way to test, learn, and experiment with various technologies and configurations in a controlled environment.

I built a free virtual IT lab from scratch on my home computer using open-source software. 
In the early 2000s the only way one could have built an IT lab was to purchase physical servers or re-purpose old computers. While this can be very beneficial as far as IT experience and skills, it can be much faster simply to build a free virtualized IT lab. 
Let's dive in!

  <h2>Virtualization Overview</h2>

So what is virtualization anyway? Basically, the IT term virtualization refers to the practice of emulating (or simulating) a computer. You can use a Virtual Machine to run a computer as an application on your host computer.
